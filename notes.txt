V and Inverse V are formed by looking at the Highs and Lows

Engulfings are formed when Open and Close of Current candle are covering COMPLETELY the High to Low of previous

Look for Bullish (V, Bullish Engulfing) pattern at the END of DOWNWARD Trend (Short DOWNWARD Trend When the overall trend is upward, it'll give benefit) as market might go up


Look for Bearish; (Inverted V, Bearish Engulfing pattern) at the END of Upward Trend (Short Upward Trend When the overall trend is down, it'll give benefit) as market might go down

Take every Opportunity (IFF satisfying risk, budget and breakout conditions) mostly COUNTER RETAILER Trades :->

Check for a Sideway Zone i.e Atleast 2 Support and 2 Resistance tests with max 1 candle breaking the zone.


If not a sideways zone, then look for 2+ either support or Resistance line. For example Overall growth is in upward trend and you find a resistance line with 2+ attempts, the moment it breaks that line, go long (buy).
